~General Description:
To write C programs that follow the HW1 instructions.

~Compiler:
The compiler is gcc.

~Requirements:
No requirements needed. Just follow the input formats for the code as stated in the instructions for HW1. The programs are already compiled so you just need to ./FileName and then add any arguments required. (NOTE: There is not testing for lack or arguments provided).

~Testing:
The way I tested my code was to test any example inputs/outputs from the instructions. From there I tried some edge cases and even tried breaking my code. I was able to conclude from my testing that my code was correct. There may be some other test cases I did not think about but I feel like I got if not all then most of them.

~Experience:
I found this assignment really enjoyable. I enjoy  just having little code projects to work on. It is very rewarding once you are finished and everything works. The first question was harder than the others and took a significant amount of more time but it was because I just rushed in and did not sit down to think about it deeply.

~Suggestions:
Honestly I do not have much to suggest for this assignment. It was pretty straight forward and I knew exactly what needed to be done and how to do it after a little thought, Overall vey good assignment.
