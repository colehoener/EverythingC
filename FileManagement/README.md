# Lab 2
By: Cole Hoener  
Class: CS-283 Section 3  
Date: 30 January 2021

## Description
To create a C program that follows the constraints as outlined in the Lab2 instructions.  
(See Lab2.c header for more info)

## Requirements
- C Compiler

## Usage

```bash
make

./Lab2 directory1 directory2
```

## Testing
I tested my code by trying all edge cases and obvious cases.

## Experience
This assignment was very long but was honestly kind of fun. A good challenge never hurts.

## Suggestions
Perhaps take away one of the requirements or just give a bit of guidance in the lab instructions themself.
