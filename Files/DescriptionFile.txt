~General Description:
To follow the prompts in the HW2 instructions (mostly from the book).

~Compiler:
The compiler is gcc.

~Requirements:
csapp.h and csapp.c

~Testing:
I tested my code by simply running it until it was correct. I put simple print statments to check what ran or didnt during testing.

~Experience:
I found this assignment to have a lot of information that seemed mroe tedious than useful but thats how C usually is to me.

~Suggestions:
The instructions for tee where a little hard to understand at first.
