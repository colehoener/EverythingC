10.6) The output to the program is "fd2 = 4". This is the output for a few reasons. 
      fd2 is a declared as an integer so obviously it will be printed as an integer.
      Secondly, it is readonly and 4 is the number of bytes of an int. So what is
      really being printed is the size of fd2 as a variable.

10.8) The logic behind it was to change the command line argument to an integeter and 
      then run it through fstat (helpful hint from the questions suggested filename). 
      The rest of the code is the same from the figure 10.10.

10.10) The question says not to change nay of the code that is already there for this one
       so I had to work around that. I added a conditional that checks if an argument was
       supplied. If so, the argument is dumped into STDIN

Tee) So for this problem I had diffuclty figuring it out. The code does not work as intended
     (at least I don't think so) since I just take the tee.c file and thats what is writing.
     trying to add more arguments to append to another text file from anothe source was too
     many errors. Anyways, the basis of this code is just checking for the argument through
     cases. If -a is there the code reads the file specified and writes it to the arguemnt file.
     If not it just prints to the screen the specified static file.
