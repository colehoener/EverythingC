HW5
12 Feburary 2021

~General Description:
To follow the prompts in the HW5 instructions (questions from the book).

~Compiler:
All text based answers. If compiling is needed then use gcc.

~Requirements:
GCC Compiler

~Testing:
I "tested" my answers just by tracing the code and writing down what I thought was happening and then doing it again to make sure. After I simply modified it, tested it by running it, and then knew my answers were correct.

~Experience:
This assignment was not as fun as last weeks. It felt much mroe tedious and where to find the answers was kind of ambiguous. I had to go back into the book a bit and found myself looking up how to handle seg faults to figure out the last question.

~Suggestions:
More guidance perhaps.
